# Move-Planner-App
A web application that takes as input from a user the street address and city of any location, and displays:
* Google streetView of the address.
* Recent New York times articles about the city.
* Useful wiki links about the city.

This application demonstrates how to make use of **jQuery's powerful ajax functionality** to perform **asynchronous HTTP requests** to web APIs.
